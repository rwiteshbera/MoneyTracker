### Money Tracker

#### Project Setup

The root folder contains `go` server. Create a `.env` and add the PORT.
```.env
PORT=5000
```

Use the following command to start the server.
```bash
air
```

Switch to `client` directory for React server. Install the dependencies and run it by using the following command.
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**NOTE**: Although I have done my best to implement as much as possible within the time available, it is possible that some bugs may be present in the project. I plan to continue working on improving the project.
